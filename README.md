ReadMe for Cleaning Data Project Week-4 CourseRA

This project gathers, cleans, and tidies up existing data from a smartphone study conducted by the University degli Studi di Genova. The code compiles all the  data from the study subsets the variables that have to do with mean and standard deviation. Lastly the code organizes the data by subject and activity, then it takes the mean values of the mean and standard deviation variables. The code will print the last data set to the console screen. 

The repository consists of:

-'run_analysis.R': code that returns a tidy data set
-'README.md'
-'UCI HAR Dataset': the data set that the code works off of

The study focused on human activity recognition by smartphones. The study consisted of 30 voluntary subjects that performed 6 different activites while wearing a Samsung smartphone (Samsung Galaxy SII) on their waist. A more detailed description of the study can be found in the ReadMe attached with the data in the working directory. 

The data set from the university includes these files:
- 'README.txt'

- 'features_info.txt': Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.

- 'features.txt': List of all features.

- 'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name.

- 'train/X_train.txt': Training set.

- 'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.

- 'test/X_test.txt': Test set.

- 'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.
